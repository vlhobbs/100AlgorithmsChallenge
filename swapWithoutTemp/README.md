You have two integers, a and b. You want to swap these two integers without using a third temporary value to hold the value of these integers. 

**Example**

If a = 4 and b = 20, at the end of the program, a = 20 and b = 4.

**Hints**
None

**Input/Output**

- **[input] integer a, integer b**

Two integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

10000 ≤ a, b ≤ 10000

-    **[output] number[]**

An array of values, with the new value of a coming before the new value of b. (There are also console logs in the program itself to show that the logic is working.)

**Notes**

The numbers start with these properties:
- (a + b) - b = a
- (a + b) - a = b
