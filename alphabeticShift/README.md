Given a string, replace each its character by the next one in the English alphabet (z would be replaced by a).

**Example**

For inputString = "crazy", the output should be
alphabeticShift(inputString) = "dsbaz".

**Hints**

-   split()
-   indexOf()
-   join()

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] string inputString**

Non-empty string consisting of lowercase English characters.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 10.

- **[output] string**

The result string after replacing all of its characters.

**Notes**

Solved: *Yes*

I added ASCII logic to use uppercase letters just because I
like adding logic for such cases, but I could have also had
the whole thing convert to lowercase in all cases. I had these
cases drilled into my head by Foundations so many times that I
hate omitting them. But I need to learn not to overprogram.
