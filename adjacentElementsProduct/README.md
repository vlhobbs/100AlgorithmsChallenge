Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

**Example**

For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be
adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

**Hints**
-   None

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] array.integer inputArray**

An array of integers containing at least two elements.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 10,
-1000 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 1000.

- **[output] integer**

The largest product of adjacent elements.

**Notes**

Solved: *Yes*

This one used the constraints to get a placeholder minimal value. 
I wonder if TS has a constant for neg. infinity I could use instead? 
(Surely it does but I did not think to check for it until just now.)
Could use that instead so that constraints could be adjusted.
