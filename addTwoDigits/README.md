You are given a two-digit integer n. Return the sum of its digits.

**Example**

For n = 29, the output should be
addTwoDigits(n) = 11.

**Hint**
-   split()
-   parseInt()
-   toString()
-   reduce()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**
- **[input] integer n**

    A positive two-digit integer.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

10 ≤ n ≤ 99.

- **[output] integer**

    The sum of the first and second digits of the input number.

**Notes**

Solved: *Yes*

Still not sure which of the two would be considered better. Probably
the one-line solution, but I feel like the longer solution is easier 
to understand by someone who is just taking a quick glance at a bit 
of unfamiliar code.
